Overall Project Software Summary from Scrath (for Developer) :

1. Create a directory/folder of any name in D/E/F drive (Never use C drive for it). e.g. ai

2. That folder should have 3 files in it i.e.
(i) Facial_Recognition_Software.py
(ii) icon.png
(iii) haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

3. Open VS Code & do following :
(i) Open this folder in it (Use "Control + K + O" & select this folder e.g. named ai).

(ii) Open Facial_Recognition_Software.py

(iii) Open Terminal (by clicking Terminal in topmost panel).

(iv) Run the following commands one by one to create & configure virtual environment :
python -m venv vev

set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Get-ExecutionPolicy

Get-ExecutionPolicy -list

vev\scripts\activate

(v) (vev) will be written in terminal after virtual environment is activated.

(vi) Now install libraries in Virtual Environment you just set named "vev" by using following commands "
pip install os-sys
pip install python-csv
pip install tk
pip install tk-tools
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install numpy
pip install imutils
pip install times
pip install urllib3

(viii) After installing libraries, then execute the code from the instructions below (common to both user & developer) :

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Instructions to run this model (for User) :

1. Create account
"""Make sure icon.png & haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml files are there in your project's directory."""
"""Also make sure Virtual environment is activated with libraries installed in it."""
- Open "Facial_Recognition_Software.py" & run it.
- Enter Name in "Name" Section, Roll No./Enrollment No. in "User ID" section & Select "Gender".
- Click "SAVE PROFILE".
- Excel sheet named "students" (students.csv) will be created having Names & Roll No.s of students.

2. Take Images
- Click "TAKE IMAGES".
- It will create a directory named "dataset".
- Then it will open another winddow to take 30 images then it will close.
- Those 30 images will be saved in a directory inside "dataset" named "Your name which you filled while creating your profile".
- These saved images will be used for recognition.

3. Recognition
- Click "RECOGNIZE" for recognizing a person based on the dataset you have.
- This can be done from multiple camera sources as per need. e.g. laptop, mobile, ESP32 with Camera Module OV-2640.
- The Recognition can be coupled with alarm systems, based on the usage of this Facial Recognition System.
